The Tawara Giraffe Sanctuary has around 120,000 visitors a year. It educates the visitors and allows them to interact with giraffes that have been rescued from the wild. Visitors' donations have so far allowed more than 1,300 giraffes to be cared for, given veterinary treatment and in most cases returned to their natural habitat.
